# IOT_FACE_EMOTION
This project focuses on deep learning techniques to discern emotions from facial images, thereby complementing the Voice Sentiment Analysis project. In this project, computer vision algorithms are integrated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) through Raspberry Pi and PiCamera for image capture as well as Flask API for communication.
